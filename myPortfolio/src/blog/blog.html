                1. What is GIT?
                GIT is a version control system. It lets users create repositories for their work, including “save points,” which will let them navigate back to previously saved version of their website without flaw.
                2. What are the advantages of using GIT?
                In addition to being able to revert to previous save points, GIT also allows users to develop new pages or features using branches that can later be merged back into the master file.
                GIT also works fast since repositories are copied to user’s computers.
                3. What language is used in GIT?
                GIT is written in ‘C’ language.
                4. Why is GIT better than Subversion?
                GIT is decentralized, meaning the user has a copy of the repository on their computer. That allows users to work when they cannot be connected to a server. GIT is also faster since it’s not having to constantly be connected to network drives.
                5. Describe one thing you learned in class today.
                I learned how to create a branch in GIT ($ git checkout -b branch-name OR $ git branch branch-name), how to identify which branch I’m in ($ git branch), and how to switch between the branch and the master file ($ git checkout branch-name).
                6. Describe your workflow and recommended workflow practice when you create a web page?
                Start by creating an HTML file in a new folder called index.html. When linking it to a CSS file, it’s typically called style.css.
                7. Explain what ARIA and screen readers are, and how to make a website accessible.
                ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. It defines how people who are blind, color blind, epileptic, or who have motor or cognitive disabilities should be able to use websites.
                There are several types of screen readers. Some take a website and read it to a person who cannot see. Others are monochrome displays to help people with colorblindness. Others can help put a website into plainer text to help people with learning difficulties.
                Making a website accessible can mean a lot of things, but a lot of it, at least from what I’ve learned so far, has to do with coding in HTML (or maybe a couple of other languages I’ll learn down the road) that would make someone with any of these disabilities able to use a website.
